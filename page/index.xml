      <description>Some examples of my work You can browse some documents I wrote and co-wrote below. I also provide custom samples on request.
Sample #1 - Open API documentation Most of the API documentation I&amp;rsquo;ve done is proprietary and internal-only, so I created and hosted my own simple RESTful web API. Then I documented it to provide that documentation as a sample.
Tools used  Python Flask SwaggerHub OAS Git/Github Heroku Atom WinSCP  Sample #2 - Internal API guide This guide documents an API for monitoring and managing a 3U SSD storage device.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technical writer with over 20 years of experience documenting retail and enterprise products of varying technical complexity. I enjoy the challenge of learning new applications and technologies, and I love writing about them to let others appreciate them as well.
Before becoming a technical writer, I was a copywriter, a slot machine salesman, a call center supervisor, and I had many other jobs in my teens and twenties. I&amp;rsquo;m also an amateur musician.</description>
