      <description>Some examples of my work Browse some documents I wrote or co-wrote below. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to provide custom samples if you would like see something written from scratch.
Note: Layout and design decisions were almost always determined by groups outside of my tech writing team (Marketing, for example), so I take no credit for look and feel.
Sample #1 - Open API documentation Most of the API documentation I&amp;rsquo;ve done is proprietary and internal-only, so I created and hosted my own simple RESTful web API.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technical writer with over 20 years of experience documenting retail and enterprise products of varying technical complexity. I enjoy the challenge of learning new applications and technologies, and I love writing about them to let others appreciate them as well.
Before becoming a technical writer, I was a copywriter, a slot machine salesman, a call center supervisor, and I had many other jobs in my teens and twenties. I&amp;rsquo;m also an amateur musician.</description>
