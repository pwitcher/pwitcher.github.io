      <description>As a job title, “technical writer” only tells part of the story. Yes, we write technical content, but we also use people skills to facilitate the writing process. The road from undocumented project to comprehensive document suite is rarely smooth, and the user documentation is often de-prioritized when resources are scarce.

      <description>Some examples of my work Browse some documents I wrote or co-wrote below. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to provide custom samples if you would like see something written from scratch.
Note: Layout and design decisions were almost always determined by groups outside of my tech writing team (Marketing, for example), so I take no credit for look and feel.
Sample #1 - Open API documentation Most of the API documentation I&amp;rsquo;ve done is proprietary and internal-only, so I created and hosted my own simple RESTful web API.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technical writer with over 20 years of experience documenting retail and enterprise products of varying technical complexity. I enjoy the challenge of learning new applications and technologies, and I love writing about them to let others appreciate them as well.
Before becoming a technical writer, I was a copywriter, a slot machine salesman, a call center supervisor, and I had many other jobs in my teens and twenties. I&amp;rsquo;m also an amateur musician.</description>
